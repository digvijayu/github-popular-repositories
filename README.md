# github-popular-repositories
A list of the most popular repositories of the last week should be displayed and the user should be able to star them. The starred repositories should be visible either through a filter or in a diferent tab. Some basic info about the repo should be displayed, such as: repo name, link to GitHub, description and number of stars. To keep things simple, the starring won’t be sent back to GitHub’s servers but just stored in localStorage.
